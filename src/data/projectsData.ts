    description: `Most backyards are just "space." At Hartscapes Landscaping, we transform them into extraordinary destinations.

We've engineered a high-end, all-weather entertainment hub—taking an outdated pool area and creating a complete masterpiece.

Why This Space Works:

✓ The Entertainer's Dream
A full outdoor kitchen featuring a built-in braai, custom counters, and a wood-fired pizza oven.

✓ Smart Utility
A fully plumbed basin means no more running back and forth to the house while you prep.

✓ All-Weather Mastery
Our custom pergola uses a rainproof clear roof for maximum light, paired with timber slats for perfect shade control.

✓ Pure Elegance
Freshly repaved pool surrounds matched with premium ceramic outdoor tiling in the lounge area.`,

This garden went from bare and building-site to lush and inviting.

A garden should start the moment you pull into the driveway. This Claremont project was all about combining hardscaping with natural beauty.

We brought this space together with:
